Forty years of the internet

Towards the end of the summer of 1969,  a few weeks after the moon landing, a few
days after Woodstock, and a month before the first broadcast of Monthy Python's
Flying Circus, a largegrey metal box was delivered to the office of Leonard
Kleinrock, a professor at the University of California in Los Angeles. It was the
same size and shape as a household refrigerator, and outwardly, but at least, it had
about as much charm, but Kleinrock was thrilled, a photograph from the time shows
him standing beside it, in requisite late 60's brown tie and brown trousers,
beaming like a proud father.
