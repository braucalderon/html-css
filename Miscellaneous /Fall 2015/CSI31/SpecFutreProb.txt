A) Specification of Future Value Problem (is a what)

Input:
	User prompted for principal and interest rate

Output:
	Bar graph giving the value of the investment each year for 10 years, where we compound interest annually.


B) Pseudo code (Design) of future value problem

1.Print out introduction 
2.Get “principle” input from user
3.Get “interest rate” input from user
Open Graph window and draw:
	[Draw Axes with Year along horizontal and dollar on vertical]
		steps of size 1
	Along vertical write “Total” and go from 0 to 10,000
	steps of 2,500
4.Current_investment = principal 
Current_year = 0
5.Repeat 11 times (comment-fort time is for principal):
	[Draw a bar as follows]:
		Heigh: current_inv
		Base: Draw at position of current_year	
	current_inv = current_inv + current_inv * interest
	
	current_year increase by 1
6.Output current_inv
